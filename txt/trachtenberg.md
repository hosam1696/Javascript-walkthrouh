# Tranchtenberg speed system of Basic Mathematics:
---

the revolutionary new method for high speed *multiplication*, *addition*, *divition*, *subtraction*, *square root*

`TrachtenBerg` is brilliant engineer with an ingenious mind he orginated his system of simplified mathematics while spending years in Hitler *Concentration Camps* as a political prisoner  

he didn't have books, papersm pens or pencils but his mind was equal to the challenge Mathematics he belived was equal to the precise thinking 

In a world gone mad, the calm logic of numbers were like old friends, his mind arranging and rearranging found new ways of manipulating them

During his long living in hill of Concentraion Camps of Hitler, every spare moment he spend on his simplified syestem of mathematics, *devisinng shortcuts* for everything from multiplication to algebra

the hardships acts as the *spur* to his genius, he worked everything in his head putting down only finished theories

* WHAT IS TRACHTENBERG SYSTEM? WHAT IT CAN DO FOR YOU? (14)

	* the trachtenberg system is based on procedures radically different from the conventional methods with which we are familiar.

	* there are no multiplication table

	* to learn the system you need only able to count

	* the method is based on a series of keys which must me memorized

	* arithemtic becomes delightfully easy as you will able to read your numbers

	* importance benifis of the system are: greated ease, greater speed, greeter accuracy



### Chapter one: **Tables of tables**

* Basic Manipulation
---

    * we shall multiply without any multilication memorized table (Does it sounds impossible, it's easy)
    
what we intend to do now is to consolidate it


**Multiplication By Eleven**


* the last number of multiplicand(number multiplied) is *put down * as a *right hand* figure

* each successive number of multiplicand is added to its neighbour to the right

* the fist number of multiplicand becomes the last hand number of the answer. 

```
546 * 11 = 6006
879844654654 * 11 =  9678291201194
```

**Multiplication By Twelve**

* Double the right hand figure and put it down 

* Double each number and add it to its neighbour

* The first number of multiplicand becomes the last hand number of the answer

```
154 * 12 = 1848
54867565*12 = 658410780
```

**Multiplication By Five, Six, Seven**

All three numbers make use of the idea of `half` of digit, we put half of digit in question mark because it's a simplified half

*we talk half the easy way by throwing any fractions*

 `multiply by six ` to each number add **half** of the neighbour

* first: first number if it has no neighbours then it has nothing to add put it down
* second: to all the seconds numbers add the alf number to it's neighbour and put it down
**if** the number is `odd` add  **5**
* last number will be the half of the first number of the figure *first number on the left* if the last number is even

```
154*6 = 924
14654647*6 = 87927882
`
most people probably fell that they knoow the multiplication table of six by heart. more than half of non mathematics people, perhaps have a feeling of confidence about it that is not the point here 
Also (and this is more important than it may sound) it is the way to start off on proper mental habits of calculation. we have all heared criticism of the reading habits of the average man and about clinics which evelop fast reading abilities

**Mental Practise**

* First:

  look at each of the following figures and immediately without going through any intermediate steps say aloud twice taht number

```
2,4,1,0,6,1,3,5,1,4,3,8,2,8,6,3,7,9,5,2,1,6,3,5,2,6,8,7,4```

```

### Rapid Multiplication by the direct method
---

we have two ways f accomplishing that each has its own advantages in certain situations yet of them are alaways capable of supplying the right answer *Fortunately* theu have agreat deal in commonso it's easy to learn both

in the present chapter we are going to considerr the one we that we call the `direct` method it's most approperiate when the numbers to be multiplied cantain small digits like  1,2,3

next chapter we shall use the other method which we call `speed multiplication` it consisits of the direct method plus a new feature. this new features takes care of diffuculties  we meet in numbers containing large digits such as 7,8,9


**Rearrangement of Factories**

this is the method that a mathematician would use the basic idea is that when we multiply together more than two numbers it doesnot make any different how we group them as long as we use them eventually in multiplying. i


**Checking the Answer**

The following method of checking our answer was not invented by professor *Trachtenberg* but it was incorporated into his system because it is s o simple and convinent it has been known for mathematechians for hundred of years **yet** it not widely used to the layman and seems to be used in everyday life for that reason we will explain it under the name of `digit-sum method`

the essence here is that we add the digits across each number as in the next paragraph

- for instance 6325
Number  6 3 2 5 
Digit-Sum 16
anotehr Digit-Sum 7
so it gives 7 => **Final| Reduced Digit-sum**

The Rule is "The Digit Sum of the product should be equal to the digitsum of the product of digit-sums of the multiplier and multiplicand"


### Rapid Multiplication by the two finger method
---

as we saw in the last chapter an importannt advantage of Trachtenberg system is thst we are able to multiply any number by any other number and write down the answer immediately the direct method we have just learned is one of general aplications it can be used in multiplying any two numbers togethr but in many cases it needs improvments which is subject of this chapter.


### Addition and right answer 
---

in the preceding chapters we developed 

each one of us has his own weaknesses and his own kind errors 

* we save the labor of repeating all the work while at the same time
* we locate the error if there is one where it is ooccured 
* we are certain to find the error which is not neccessarly the case if we repeat all the work

A simple short-cut:

to make our adddition even easier you will notice that when using the `eleven-rule` we cannot go over 19 when we running down a column. the first or left-hand digit 16 => 6 => 5

### Division and Accuracy
---

It was a first day of school in a large America university In one of the room thirty students of the first year algebra had gathered to hear lecture from the head of mathematics department. he had raken the assignment himself for good reason he wants to know that the students have the solid foundation for their later work 

Remeber these were college students they had all learned the method in grammer school had studied further mathematics in high school and had passed all their courses. the same test applied to the general population would have given even worse results. *the explanation is that* we are not tought to be sure of getting the right ansers we are not made to appreciate the fact that a problem is not finished until we have the right answer  *In Fact* a **problem** is not finished until we have the right answer not just the answer In Fact a problem is not finished until we have proved that we have the right answer.



* simple method for non mathematichien

	

* fast method anyone who is liking for figures will enjoy this
