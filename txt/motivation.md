## Hard Times makes you stronger
---

imagine if you got what uyou want everytime
imagine if you got what you want everytime no struggle no hardwork, no challenges, no hard work required 
some of you are saying that would be great

you can not develop strength without resistance, without challenging youself, without stuggle

pain is your friend maybe not this moment but for evolotion of your soul for long term benifit 

we were given pain because we are storng enough to handle it
we are given this life because we are strong enough to live in it

## Hard work versus Talent
---

i used to hate you when you called my name i heared and i ran away from him 

when i know you are coming i still hiding from you 
when you influance others to talk to me quickly i get execuses to get away from you. afraid of pain because i won't being get hurt 

the **sware** on my face and tears on my eyes

you need to have inlogical and inrational 

thie divil whispered 
you cannot withstand the storm 

i don't *survive* 
i ***thrive***

pivotal moment in your development

* first lecture (BREAK THE RULES)

let me tell you a story so friend of mine and i we went for a run in central park
the roud runner organization in the weekend they host races
and it's very common at the end of the race they'll have the sponser who will give away something (apples or bagels or something)

and in this particular day we got to the end of the run there were free bagels
and they have tables set up and on the one side are group of volunteers who are holding boxes of bagels and the other side was a long line of runners 

i tell my friend free bagels i was like "free bagel" and he said not it's too long
and once i realized there's two ways to see the world
- some people see the thing they want 
- some people see the things that prevents them from getting the things they want

i can only see the bagels he could only see the line so i walked up to the line leaned in between two ppeoples put my hand on the box and pull out two bagels and no one get mad of me because the rule is is go after whatever you want you just cannot ddeny anyone else to go after what they want now i had to sacrifice a choice which bagels should i pick up i just pulled what i got

so the point is you don't have to wait in line 
you don't do it the way other people are doing you can do it yourway you can break the rules
