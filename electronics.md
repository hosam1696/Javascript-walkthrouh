## Electronics Devices and Circuits theory
---

as indicated earlier, hte primary ppurpose of this section is to introduce the characterstics of an ideal device for comparison of the commercial variey 

> how close will the foreward or "on" resistance of a practical diode compare with the desired 0- ohm level >

> is the reverse-bias resistance sufficiently large to permit an open circuit approximation?



#### Semi Conductors (silicon and Germanium)


**Bipolar junction transistor** p-type or n-type > dc biasing is neccessary to establish the proper region of operation for ac amplifications
* Emitter is heavily dopped
* Base is lightly dopped
* Collector is lightly dopped

BJT the term *Bipolar* reflects the fact that holes and electrons participate in the injection process into the oppositely polorized material

**Transistors Classifications**

* Bibolar Junction Transistor (BJT)

* Field Effect Transistor (FET) => Metal Oxide semiconductor Field Effict transistor

1: junction FET

	- n-channel
	- p-channel

2: Metal Oxide semiconductor (MOZ)FET

	- Deplition-mode
		- n-channel
		- p-channel
	- Enhancement-mode
		- n-channel
		- p-channel



### Batteries
---

we will focus on electriccal side rather than the chemical reactions


How to build Circuits: *Practical Electronics for inventors* provides hands-on instruction for designning using circuits programs simulators, rules of safety, using breadboards, making printed circuit boards, heat sinking,


`V=IR`  `P=VI`

- Thevinen Theorem:
 say that we are given a circuit such as that shown in FIG2.17 pretend that you are interested in knowing the voltage will be across the terminal A and F and what is thr amount of curernt will flow through a load resistor attached between these terminals

> if only two terminals are of interest these two terminals these termials can be extracted from the complex circuits and the rest of the circuit can be considered as block box*

### Contactor
---

used to deal with high voltages

nutral or normal phase or two or three
