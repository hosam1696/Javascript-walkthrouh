* **centeral process unit (CPU)**:
    this carries out the instructions of a computer program by performingg the basic arthmetic, logical, control and IO

* **Graphical processor unit (GPU)**:
    this is specialized processor is used in manipulation and alteration of memeory to accelerate the creation images in a freame buffer intended for output to display

* **Hard Disk Drive (HDD) || Solid State Drive (SSD)**: 
    Both of these are data storage devices used to store and retrieve information



 >As performance is influenced by the availability of multible types of physical and virtual device, we can find a few different performance metrics *(factors to measure performance)*
 includes :-

* **availability**
* **response time**

    is the amout of time that it takes to respond to a request of a server the response time can be divided into three parts:

    * *wait time*:
        the time that the request will spend waiting for other requests
    * *servic time*:
                the time that the serveice to be completed
    * *Transmition time*

* **processing speed**

    processig speed also known as *clock rate* refers to the frequency at which a processing unit (cpu or gpu) runs
    the higher  the clock rate the more instructions will be completed

* **latency**
* **bandwidth**

    *data transfer rate* is the amount of data that can be transmitted from one place to another , the bandwidth speed is usually expressed by bits per seconds
* **scalability**
