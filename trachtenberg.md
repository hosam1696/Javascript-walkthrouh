# Tranchtenberg speed system of Basic Mathematics:
---

the revolutionary new method for high speed *multiplication*, *addition*, *divition*, *subtraction*, *square root*

`TrachtenBerg` is brilliant engineer with an ingenious mind he orginated his system of simplified mathematics while spending years in Hitler *Concentration Camps* as a political prisoner  

he didn't have books, papersm pens or pencils but his mind was equal to the challenge Mathematics he belived was equal to the precise thinking 

In a world gone mad, the calm logic of numbers were like old friends, his mind arranging and rearranging found new ways of manipulating them

During his long living in hill of Concentraion Camps of Hitler, every spare moment he spend on his simplified syestem of mathematics, *devisinng shortcuts* for everything from multiplication to algebra

the hardships acts as the *spur* to his genius, he worked everything in his head putting down only finished theories

* WHAT IS TRACHTENBERG SYSTEM? WHAT IT CAN DO FOR YOU? (14)

	* the trachtenberg system is based on procedures radically different from the conventional methods with which we are familiar.

	* there are no multiplication table

	* to learn the system you need only able to count

	* the method is based on a series of keys which must me memorized

	* arithemtic becomes delightfully easy as you will able to read your numbers

	* importance benifis of the system are: greated ease, greater speed, greeter accuracy



### Chapter one: **Tables of tables**

* Basic Manipulation
---

    * we shall multiply without any multilication memorized table (Does it sounds impossible, it's easy)
    
what we intend to do now is to consolidate it


**Multiplication By Eleven**


* the last number of multiplicand(number multiplied) is *put down * as a *right hand* figure

* each successive number of multiplicand is added to its neighbour to the right

* the fist number of multiplicand becomes the last hand number of the answer. 

```
546 * 11 = 6006
879844654654 * 11 =  9678291201194
```

**Multiplication By Twelve**

* Double the right hand figure and put it down 

* Double each number and add it to its neighbour

* The first number of multiplicand becomes the last hand number of the answer

```
154 * 12 = 1848
54867565*12 = 658410780
```

**Multiplication By Five, Six, Seven**

All three numbers make use of the idea of `half` of digit, we put half of digit in question mark because it's a simplified half

*we talk half the easy way by throwing any fractions*

 `multiply by six ` to each number add **half** of the neighbour

* first: first number if it has no neighbours then it has nothing to add put it down
* second: to all the seconds numbers add the alf number to it's neighbour and put it down
**if** the number is `odd` add  **5**
* last number will be the half of the first number of the figure *first number on the left* if the last number is even

```
154*6 = 924
14654647*6 = 87927882
```
